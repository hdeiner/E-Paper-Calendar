# Contribution Policy the E-Paper Calendar software

Thanks for contributing to the E-Paper Calendar Software!

If you wish to contribute, please test your suggestion for at least one week on your own E-Paper first. Often, a small change makes a lot
of difference so it's important to check how well your suggestion can perform. 

A testing time for 1 week is set as the E-Paper software takes 1 days for a daily cycle, 7 days for a weekly cycle and 1 month for a 
montly cycle. Usually, if it works for the daily and weekly cycle, there shouldn't be any issues in the monthly cycle.
